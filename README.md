# DigitalSignature
A small example for hashing messages and adding a random UUID which then gets encrypted with the private key to create a digital signature.
Also includes a function to verify this same digital signature and includes an example of what happens when integrity is broken by changing an object before verification.
This can be used in the backend when the stream has to fulfill the need for integrity of data.
